<h2>About Me</h2>
    </main>
<p>Hello! I'm John Doe, a passionate software developer with over 10 years of experience in the tech industry. I specialize in web development and have worked on numerous projects ranging from small personal websites to large-scale enterprise applications.</p>
<p>My journey into programming began at a young age when I was introduced to coding through a summer camp. Since then, I've been hooked on creating innovative solutions and solving complex problems through code. Over the years, I've honed my skills in various programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.</p>
